# Step 1: Define a function palind(r) that checks whether a tuple is a palindrome.
def palind(r):
    e=len(r)-1
    s=0
    while s<e:
        if r[s]!=r[e]:
            return False
        s+=1
        e-=1
    return True
abc=palind((1,2,3,3,2,1))
if abc:
    print("It is Flipflop!")
else:
    print("Not a Flipflop!")
print(abc)
# Step 2: Set e to the tuple's last index, and s to its first index, 0.

# Step 3: Use a while loop that keeps comparing r[s] and r[e] as long as s is less than e.

# Step 4: Return False immediately the moment two compared items do not match.

# Step 5: Move s forward by one and e backward by one after every successful match.

# Step 6: Return True once the loop finishes without finding any mismatch.

# Step 7: Call palind(r) on r = (1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1) and print whether it is Flip-Flop or not.
